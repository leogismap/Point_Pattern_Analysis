# Point_Pattern_Analysis
Point Pattern Analysis for crime in LA

Points can be understood in two ways:

Fixed Locations: Points represent fixed places where data is collected. For example, recording robberies at police stationsâ€”stations are fixed, and the focus is on the number of robberies reported there.

Measurement Sites: Points represent locations where events occur within a broader process. For example, robberies can happen anywhere, but they tend to occur in specific areas based on factors like foot traffic and socioeconomic conditions.

When robberies happen at certain locations but could have occurred elsewhere, they form a point pattern. For example, street robberies in a city are not evenly distributed but cluster in certain hotspots. If only locations are analyzed, it's an unmarked pattern. If additional details (e.g., time of robbery, weapon used) are included, it's a marked pattern.

This project used the crime data from https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/data_preview
